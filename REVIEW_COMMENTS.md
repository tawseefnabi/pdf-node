1. Great work transitioning the codebase to TypeScript and ESM! This is a major modernization step.
2. Please make sure all new or renamed files follow the expected project structure and naming conventions.
3. Verify TypeScript configuration settings for compatibility with existing build and deployment pipelines.
4. Consider adding or updating documentation to reflect TypeScript usage and ESM requirements.
5. Ensure test coverage is updated for new TypeScript modules, and all tests pass after migration.
6. Review any breaking changes for downstream consumers and highlight them in release notes.
